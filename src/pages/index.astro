  <h2>My name is Andrea Ristori and I'm currently a Lead Experience Designer at <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a>.</h2>
  <h3>My work philosophy</h3>
  <p>As a designer, I want to give the entire team understanding of the problems we're trying to solve in a way that balances user needs, business goals and tech capabilities.  Nothing brings me as much joy as removing ambiguity and shaping clear, actionable strategies for the entire team to follow. I relentlessly break down gigantic projects into small Lean chunks to continuosly deliver valuable features and continuously celebrate tangible improvements. I also have experience teaching Agile methodologies and mentoring junior designers, both individually and as a group.</p>

  <h3>My story</h3>
  <p>I was born in Italy, where I was raised until the early 2000s. I moved to Madison, Wisconsin for my college years (go Badgers!) and ultimately settled in Barcelona at the beginning of 2008. I'm happily married and have a baby daughter, Lucia. In my spare time I play guitar, love reading a mind-bending book (sci-fi, horror, thrillers and the like), have a passion for good coffee, strategy videogames and karaoke. Lately I've been taking an interest in generative AI, particularly Stable Diffusion and creative coding with Processing and P5.js</p>

  <h3>This place</h3>
  <p>This is where I gather my projects and thoughts, while experimenting with all sorts of pipelines. My current tech stack includes handcoding for <a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build">Astro CMS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> and using continuous automated deployment with <a target="_blank" href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>. Things might break from time to time and that's ok :)</p>
  <!-- <p>This page is connected to Netlify for automated deployment. Sweet!</p> -->
